# Buggy Todo App Challenge

Welcome to the Buggy Todo App Challenge! This project is a simple todo application intentionally created with bugs and bad practices. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to identify and fix these issues within a 20-minute time limit.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies
4. Run the development server
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

## The Challenge

Your task is to identify and fix as many bugs and bad practices as you can within 20 minutes. Here are some guidelines:

- There are at least 4 major bugs in the application.
- Look for both functional bugs and code quality issues.
- Pay attention to React best practices and JavaScript conventions.
- Consider adding type checking (PropTypes or TypeScript) if time allows.

## Tips for Bug Hunting

1. Start by using the app and look for any obvious functional issues.
2. Review the code in each component, focusing on:
- State management
- Event handlers
- Prop passing
- Rendering logic
3. Check for console errors and warnings.
4. Look for inconsistencies in coding style and naming conventions.
5. Consider edge cases and how the app handles them.

## Submission

After the 20-minute time limit:

1. Create a new branch with your fixes & open a pr
2. By the end of 2nd talk we will declare the winnner ! <3
